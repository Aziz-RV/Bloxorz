This project was made as my first semester project for my VR major.  
The game is based on the game shown in the photo called Bloxors. The purpose of the game being to move an object on a platform until it reaches the empty square and makes it fall there, this is how the player goes to the next level. If the player completes all the levels, he wins the game. For my project, I made only two levels. For this game we used C++/OpenGL.  
# How to move:  
Keyboard arrows ⭢ Moving the object on the platform  
S ⭢ Go to the next level    
The right button on a mouse ⭢ Menu (You can change the color or exit the game)
